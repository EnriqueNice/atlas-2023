	"description": "Since Belgium invented the fries, they sell them everywhere. A friterie or frituur (a restaurant that only serves fries and other fried snacks) can be found anywhere in the country, and the puntzak (a pointy bag) is a popular way to carry fries around. It's similar to the newspaper bag you get with English fish and chips.",
